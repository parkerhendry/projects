# SMS High-Low Game
This app uses Express and Twilio to create an SMS high-low game. Each time a text is sent to Twilio, Twilio makes an HTTP POST request to the Express web server. This app then creates the appropriate response based on the request. DISCLAIMER: I was using a free-trial version of Twilio when I made this, so the number I was using is no longer available. However, I can buy a new number anytime I want to use this app. 
# Instructions for use
After starting the web server and exposing it using ngrok, text Twilio to begin the game.
