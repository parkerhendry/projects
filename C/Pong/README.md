# Two-Player Pong
Welcome to Pong! This is a two person game, with the first person utilizing the 'W' and 'S' keys while the second player utilizes the up arrow and down arrow for movement. This 'movement' moves each paddle so that each player can hit the ball. This was implemented using C and the ncurses.h library.
