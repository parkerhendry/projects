# Hash Table with Separate Chaining Collision Resolution
This program is an implementation of an integer hash table using the separate chaining collision resolution technique. When maintaining a load factor close to 1, this technique provides very efficient dictionary operations. While in the worst case these operations can degrade to O(n), they have best and average case time efficiencies of O(1).
