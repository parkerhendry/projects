# Word Find
This program accepts a word find grid as the first command line argument. The second command line argument is optional, but a list of words to search for can be used. If only one command line argument is specified, the user will be prompted for words to search for. This program is designed to only work with the word find grid format used in the file _cashiers.txt_. _cashwords.txt_ is an example list of words that can be searched for.
