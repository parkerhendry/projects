# P2P
Welcome to my Email application! This app uses socket programming to connect to an SMTP server, which is then used to send emails. The user can choose the SMTP server as well as the originator, recipient, subject, and body of the email. 

PS: If you are using a network interface other than wlp2s0, please change line 38 to your correct network interface.
