# Expectation Maximization Clustering Algorithm
This is an implementation of the Expectation Maximization k-means clustering algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. This program prompts the user for a value of k (number of centroids) and a value of Ïƒ. At the end, the quality of the clustering is evaluated using the Davies-Bouldin Index and the clustering is also plotted for a visualization to the user.
