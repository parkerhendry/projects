# Set Operations Assignment
In this assignment, I created a Javascript application that will perform set operations on integer sets.The set operations include union, intersection, and set difference. The application supports a switch argument and two arguments that hold sets. The switch argument represents the set operation, and the application also includes a help switch. Use '' to denote sets. 
# Instructions for use
node set.js [OPTION] ['SET1'] ['SET2'] 
# Options
-h, --help\
	Output a usage message and exit.\
-u, --union\
	Outputs a set in Array form of elements in Number form that are either in SET1 or SET2\
-i, --intersection\
	Outputs a set in Array form of elements in Number form that are in *both* SET1 and SET2\
-d, --difference\
	Outputs a set in Array form of elements in Number form that are in SET1 unless they are in SET2
