# Binary Search Tree
This program is an implementation of a binary search tree. This implementation uses a template class for the tree enabling it to accept multiple data types. The currently supported data types are int, double, char, and string. After the user is prompted for the data items, the items are inserted into the tree. The tree is printed using preorder traversal (root, left subtree, right subtree), inorder traversal (left subtree, root, right subtree), and postorder traversal (left subtree, right subtree, root).
