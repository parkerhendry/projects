# Insertion Sort Analysis
This program performs the decrease-and-conquer algorithm insertion sort on randomly ordered arrays, arrays sorted in ascending order, and arrays sorted in descending order. The basic operation (key comparison) is counted for each sort and used for empirical analysis of time efficiency. The empirical analysis is located in _Analysis.xlsx_.
