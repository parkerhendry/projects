# File Sort
This program accepts files and/or user input and sorts the lines using an iterative (bottom up) version of merge sort. The program accepts files through command line arguments, and user input is given by passing a "-" (dash) as a command line argument. User input is read until an EOF signal is given. Any number of files can be used.
