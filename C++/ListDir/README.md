# Custom List Directory
This program is a custom implementation of the ls command. This will print file permssions, directory status, name, size, and last modified date. The directory path is printed before the directory contents. A directory path can be given after ./listdir, when no path is provided the current directory's contents are displayed. 
# Instructions for use
`````
make
./listdir [DIRECTORY]
`````
