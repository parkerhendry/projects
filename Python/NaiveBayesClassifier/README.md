# Naive Bayes Classifier
This is a Naive Bayes Classifier, which is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm. This classifier will label instances of mushrooms either edible or poisonous. The mushrooms are included in the data files and each have a different combination of attributes. This algorithm uses Bayes theorem to find probabilities for each combination, which is then used for classification. This model also accepts m-estimates, which act as virtual samples. With an m-estimate of 0, this model has an accuracy of 99.7% on the training data and an accuracy of 99.5% on the testing data.
